My website

This is just for my personal use, but you might find it interesting too.

To start a new blog post:
```
$ npm run new-blog
```

`new-blog` creates a new markdown file with today's date and puts it in
`static/blogposts`.

To build the whole website/blog:
```
$ npm run build-blog
```

Once the blog is built, publish it with:
```
$ npm run publish-blog
```
